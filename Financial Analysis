Explanation:
Total Revenue: Summing the 'Revenue' column gives you the total revenue earned by the company over the period in the dataset.

Total Costs: The same method is applied to the 'Costs' column to calculate total costs.

Profit Calculation: Profit is calculated by subtracting Costs from Revenue for each entry.

Profit Margin: The profit margin shows how much profit is made from each dollar of revenue. It’s calculated as (Profit / Revenue) * 100.

Return on Investment (ROI): ROI measures the efficiency of investments. It’s calculated as (Profit / Investment) * 100. The Investment column must be present in your dataset.

Cost-to-Revenue Ratio: This ratio shows how much of the revenue is consumed by costs, helping you understand operational efficiency.

Financial Summary: This step generates basic descriptive statistics (mean, min, max, etc.) for key financial metrics like Revenue, Profit, and ROI.

Saving Results: The financial data with calculated metrics is saved to a new CSV file (financial_analysis_with_metrics.csv) for further review.

What It’s For:
Evaluating Business Performance: By calculating revenue, profit, ROI, and other metrics, you can assess how well a company is performing financially.

Decision-Making: These insights help guide decisions on where to cut costs, invest, or improve operations.

Profitability and Efficiency: Analyzing profit margins and cost ratios gives insight into how efficiently a company is generating profit from its revenue.

This code helps perform a thorough financial analysis, making it easy to evaluate a company’s financial health.
